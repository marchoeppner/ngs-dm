IFSAC_category	The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available from https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html PMID: 28926300	array	true

study_timecourse	For time-course research studies involving samples of the food commodity, indicate the total duration of the time-course study	string	false
study_tmnt	A process in which the act is intended to modify or alter some other material entity.  From the study design, each treatment is comprised of one level of one or multiple factors. This field accepts terms listed under treatment (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MCO_0000866). If the proper descriptor is not listed please use text to describe the study treatment. Multiple terms can be separated by one or more pipes	array	false
subspecf_gen_lin	Information about the genetic distinctness of the sequenced organism below the subspecies level, e.g., serovar, serotype, biotype, ecotype, or any relevant genetic typing schemes like Group I plasmid. Subspecies should not be recorded in this term, but in the NCBI taxonomy. Supply both the lineage name and the lineage rank separated by a colon, e.g., biovar:abc123	string	false
target_gene	Targeted gene or locus name for marker gene studies	string	true
target_subfragment	Name of subfragment of a gene or locus. Important to e.g. identify special regions on marker genes like V6 on 16S rRNA	string	false
temp	Temperature of the sample at the time of sampling	string	false
timepoint	Time point at which a sample or observation is made or taken from a biomaterial as measured from some reference point. Indicate the timepoint written in ISO 8601 format	string	false
trophic_level	Trophic levels are the feeding position in a food chain. Microbes can be a range of producers (e.g. chemolithotroph)		false
